Basic strategy for applying topology:
-------------------------------------
1. Problem complicated by degeneracies (unfortunate circumstances that make the problem difficult)
2. Deform the problem to a generic situation free from degeneracies
3. This problem has a simple solution
4. Deform back the solution to obtain a solution to the original problem

Note: we can use the same approach to show that some problems are unsolvable.

ex.
  P, Q matrices of size n x n
  PQ != QP in general, but show that they have the same eigenvalues (*)
sol.
  Q(PQ)Q^-1 = QP
  so, PQ, QP are matrices of the same linear transformation, so (*) holds
comment
  this argument works only when Q is invertable (Q^-1 exists),
  i.e. only when det Q != 0
  But,
  Q is invertible in most situations, in the sense that
  if Q is invertible => small perturbations of Q remain invertible
  if Q is noninvertible => small perturbations of Q become invertibleV.I.
